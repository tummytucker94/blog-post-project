        <h2>Ladder of Abstraction</h2>
        <q>Think in Hierarchies&mdash;Aristotle</q>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          The famous philosopher Aristotle once said, &#34;think in hierarchies&#34;. By this he meant, think in levels as everything in the universe exist on some type of level. Furthermore, Polish philosopher and founder of General Semantics, Alfred Korzybsk advocated for a <i>Consciousness of Abstraction</i> in which he wanted people to become aware of the fact that the map is not the territory; or put in simpler words, the word is not the object. And in acquiring consciousness of abstraction, we free ourselves from the abstract words and clouded meanings. Borrowing from Aristotle's and Korzybski's wisdom, the Japense&ndash;American and General Semanticist S.I. Hayakawa coined a terminology known as the Ladder of Abstraction.

        <h3>Body</h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>Ladder of Abstraction</dfn> is a diagram created by S.I.Haykawa in which higher up the ladder that one travels up the ladder the less clear things become. Or, in other words, the more abstracted something becomes.The more something is abstracted; the more its individual associations and attributes are stripped away from it. Consequently, when this is done to ideas, they become harder to understand because each person has their own interpretation of what the idea means to them. So when someone uses words such as Democracy, Love, Equality, and Racism, they are speaking in high abstractions and not of anything concrete.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The ladder of abstraction is a good mental model to use especially in computer science because concepts such as class and objects deal with the ladder of abstraction. Whereas, a class is more abstract than an object. And, when an object is given an id attribute, it is less abstract.
